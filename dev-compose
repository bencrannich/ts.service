## Helper script for running Compose commands with the correct set of YAML
## (and data) files for the default development environment

## This script must be run from the top-level source directory

## To use this script, simply invoke it as you would "docker compose", e.g.:
#
# ./dev-compose logs -f
#
# All configurable parameters are passed via environment variables (see below),
# and any arguments you specify are passed directly to Compose

## Environment variables you can set:
#
# Variable          Default value       Type      Description
#
# COMPOSE           docker compose      String    Compose command name
# TS_DEV_NAME       tsdev               String    Compose project name

COMPOSE=${COMPOSE:-'docker compose'}
TS_DEV_NAME=${TS_DEV_NAME:-'tsdev'}
